PROBLEM STATEMENT

Given the present day risk of possible fraud in online transaction processing and the need to have digital infrastrutures in place for 24/7 monitoring of these online transactions; Blossom Bank wants to build a Machine Learning Model to predict online fraud to prevent loss of revenue and also save the banks image in the financial industry.

STEPS TAKEN

The dataset was provided in .csv file format and Exloratory Data Analysis (Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate) was perfomred to have a better understanding of the dateset and also for better visualization. 3 ML Algorithms (Random Forest, K-Neighbors and Linear Regression) to find the accuracy. The dataset was further separated into train and test data at 80:20 ratio respectively. It was further evaluated using confusion matrix which gave the outcome of Random Forest (0 FP and 0 FN with an accuracy score-100%) as a better ML Algorithm to be deployed by Blossom Bank to predict online payment fraud.
